Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

This is an implementation of the tic-tac-toe game.

Running Locally
---------------

This project uses `npm` for managing dependencies. After you clone
the repository, install the dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Bundle and pre-process the JavaScript with:

```sh
npm run-script build
```

(`npm run-script watch` is also available)

Then you can open `build/index.html` in your browser.

The tests can be run with:

```sh
npm test
```

Goals
-----

- [ ] Use React: A JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces.
- [ ] Allow for more than one independent tic­tac­toe board to be on the
same page without anything breaking.
- [ ] Add the ability to restart a game after it has ended.
- [ ] Use module loaders like webpack or browserify for dependency
management.
- [ ] Write error handling and/or tests.
