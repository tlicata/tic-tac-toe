Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

This is an implementation of the tic-tac-toe game.

Running Locally
---------------

This project uses `npm` for managing dependencies. After you clone
this repository, you can install its dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

We also use `webpack` for bundling our JavaScript. Before you load
`index.html` in your browser, you'll need to run:

```sh
./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

Goals
-----

- [ ] Use React: A JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces.
- [ ] Allow for more than one independent tic­tac­toe board to be on the
same page without anything breaking.
- [ ] Add the ability to restart a game after it has ended.
- [ ] Use module loaders like webpack or browserify for dependency
management.
- [ ] Write error handling and/or tests.
